## RoadMap:

UI (mobile)
Limit + Market
Last PnL
Trade History per symbol ( limitted )
Add limit order
Load order into the chart
Allow to update order from chart lines movement
Allow to TP with limit order
Allow to remove TP or SL from the chart toolbox
Check 2 position way. hard due to lack of control of lines for now. maybe having dynamic lines can help specially with an ID


## Status

feels bug free.

## Known bugs

sometimes when changing ticker the old SL lines is not removed. Also on the close of some positions the line is not deleted.

its not creating new orders. but feels bad.
